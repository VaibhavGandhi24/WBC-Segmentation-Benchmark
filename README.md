# WBC-Segmentation-Benchmark
Reproducibility package for “Interpretability-driven deep learning for WBC segmentation

White Blood Cell Segmentation Script
Enhanced Minimal Version 
Paper: Interpretability-Driven Multi-Dataset Benchmarking of DL Models for WBC Segmentation

Purpose:
    This enhanced reproducibility script provides:
        - Model configuration loading
        - Dataset split loading
        - Placeholder dataset loader
        - Placeholder model class
        - Pseudo-training loop (transparent but non-functional)
        - Full evaluation metrics (Dice, IoU, BFScore, HD)
        - Explainability placeholders (Grad-CAM, Attention, LRP)
